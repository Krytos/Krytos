I'm a Python Developer passionate about building efficient, scalable solutions and automating complex workflows. My focus is on backend development, cloud-native applications, and leveraging AI to enhance processes. I enjoy transforming manual tasks into streamlined automated systems and continuously exploring new ways to optimize performance and developer experience. Currently, I'm also **expanding my skills into C programming to explore my interest in embedded systems.** Native German and English speaker.

## üöÄ What I Love To Do & Core Strengths

Here's a look at the kind of work I excel at, enjoy, and am currently exploring:

### üêç Python Development & Backend Systems
I build robust and scalable backend applications, primarily using **Python, Django, and FastAPI**. My experience includes:
-   Developing complex API-driven services and microservice architectures.
-   Implementing asynchronous task processing with **Celery** to handle intensive operations without impacting user experience, significantly improving application responsiveness under load.
-   Designing and managing various databases (**PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB**).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Automation & Efficiency
I have a knack for identifying bottlenecks and automating manual processes.
-   **Reduced manual workloads by ~60%** in various projects by developing custom Python scripts and automation tools.
-   Engineered ETL pipelines for data extraction, transformation, and loading, improving data accessibility and reporting accuracy.
-   Saved **~10 hours of manual effort per week** on data processing tasks through targeted automation.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è DevOps, CI/CD & Cloud Solutions
I'm experienced in creating and maintaining efficient development-to-production pipelines and leveraging cloud infrastructure.
-   Designing and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, leading to **~70% faster release cycles.**
-   Expertise in **Docker** for containerization, including multi-stage builds and creating optimized **DevContainer** setups for consistent development environments.
-   Deploying and managing applications on **AWS** (utilizing Lambda, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB for serverless architectures) and other cloud platforms.

### ü§ñ AI Integration & Advanced Solutions
I'm enthusiastic about integrating AI to create innovative solutions.
-   Successfully integrated **Stability AI and ComfyUI** for advanced AI image generation, enabling automated text-to-image workflows that **increased content output by ~1000%** in a creative asset management context.
-   Developed systems for intelligent template-based generation and metadata extraction for AI processing pipelines.

### üß™ Quality Assurance & Testing
I believe in building reliable software through rigorous testing.
-   Championing **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices using **Pytest**.
-   Implementing comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing with tools like **Playwright**.

### üî¨ Continuous Learning & Exploration
I'm committed to ongoing skill development and exploring new technological frontiers.
-   Currently deepening my understanding of hardware interaction and low-level programming by **learning C with a focus on embedded systems.**
